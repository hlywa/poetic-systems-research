# Poetic Systems Research

This repository is the scholarly backbone of my work on poetic systems, combinatorial meaning, and computational dramaturgy. It houses the diagrams, theory documents, and lineage maps that inform all my creative projects, including **In Countless Shadows**, **Alexandria**, **Strike at the Wrong Shadow**, and **Altars to Memory**.

## Purpose

Poetic systems treat texts as structured meaning engines. This research explores how rules, constraints, and inferential grammars generate interpretation. It draws from Shakespearean tension fields, constraint systems, AI reasoning models, and combinatorial poetics.

## Structure

**diagrams**  
Mermaid markdown diagrams for system models, research lineages, tension fields, and structural frameworks. These can be rendered directly on GitHub and exported as SVGs.

**theory**  
Research statements, systems frameworks, RIKLS inference notes, and foundational documents.

**examples**  
Applications of this research in creative works, including how **In Countless Shadows** implements sonnet logic, constraint puzzles, and combinatorial reasoning.

**assets**  
Exported SVG and PNG versions of diagrams for Notion and portfolio usage.
